                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Smit Bhoraniya, currently in final year of Computer Science Engineering at Dharmsinh Desai University Nadiad. I have done my schooling from Nirmal Vidhyalaya, Morbi. Ever since my school days, I was good at problem-solving. I enjoy development and coding. And so later I decided to pursue a career of my choice in engineering. I solved 500+ questions across multiple platforms. I have been working on C++, JS, and Python and have knowledge of OOPS, OS, DBMS, and DSA. I have done several projects during my engineering in the areas of Web development, Machine learning, etc. I have worked in react js, node js, express js, flask, MongoDB, SQL, etc. With this I believe that I am someone who believes in the objective of Learn, Grow, Contribute and Achieve.
